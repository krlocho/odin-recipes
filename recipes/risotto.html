    <h1>Risotto</h1>
    <p>This mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
    <p>Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. This 5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of ratings and reviews, and is a top-rated favorite for our Allrecipes community of home cooks.</p>
